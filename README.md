# LibraryThing Browser

This is a simple offline browser for LibraryThing users. You can download your public or private library and use it offline to search and browse your books, comments, and reviews, but you can't edit the data. You can also search for books in your library with a barcode scanner.
 
I am not affiliated with LibraryThing at all, just a regular user tinkering in my spare time.

You can install the app from:

* The Google Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nietky.librarythingbrowser
* [Download APKs](https://bitbucket.org/sbearlt/librarything-browser/downloads)

You can discuss the app:

* The LT Talk thread in Recommend Site Improvements : Android App at http://www.librarything.com/topic/121348) -- this is probably the best place
* Feel free to write me an email at kinverarity1@gmail.com
* The librarything-browser group / mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/librarything-browser, although this is not currently in use.

See the [changelog](https://bitbucket.org/sbearlt/librarything-browser/src/newmaster/NEWS) for what's in the latest version.

If you have a Github account please raise any issues or submit pull requests [here](https://github.com/kinverarity1/librarything-browser/issues) at Github, all bug reports and suggested features are welcome.

The code is released under the MIT Expat Licence.

The ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and INTERNET permissions are required in order to
download your library from the LibraryThing website. Network access can also
used for sending debugging logs to the developer at your choice, although this
is not normally used and is disabled by default.
