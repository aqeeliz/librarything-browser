# LibraryThing Browser

This is a simple offline browser for LibraryThing users. You can download your public or private library and use it offline to search and browse your books, comments, and reviews, but you can't edit the data. You can also search for books in your library with a barcode scanner.
 
I am not affiliated with LibraryThing at all, just a regular user tinkering in my spare time.

You can install the app from:

* The Google Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nietky.librarythingbrowser
* Or download individual release APKs from https://github.com/kinverarity1/librarything-browser/tree/newmaster/APKs

The best place to discuss the app is in the LT Talk thread at http://www.librarything.com/topic/121348, although you are also welcome to raise any issues or submit pull requests [here](https://github.com/kinverarity1/librarything-browser/issues) at Github, or feel free to contact me directly at kinverarity1@gmail.com.

For what's in the latest version check https://github.com/kinverarity1/librarything-browser/blob/newmaster/NEWS.

Note that the ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and INTERNET permissions are required on your device in order to download your library from the LibraryThing website. Network access can also be used for sending debugging logs to the developer at your choice, although this is not normally used and is disabled by default.

The code is released under the MIT Expat Licence.
