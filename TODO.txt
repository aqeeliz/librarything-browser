2a. Rework the import code into ONE AsyncTask, like the new & discarded ImportTask

2ai. Change the dbHelper import code to import dates as yyyy-mm-dd

2aii. Add indexing commands for each of the fields I want to sort on

3. The SQL is there, in the sorting branch; it's just a bit slow, so I want to add the indexing and then ask jjmcgaffey and others to test out a beta version
