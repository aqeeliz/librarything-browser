1b. Add a menu to Book Details that gives an title + author field.. or a dialog that can select all the fields in one thing.

2a. Rework the import code into ONE AsyncTask, like the new & discarded ImportTask

2b. Adjust the db add method so it adds dates as yyyy-mm-dd

3. Add a ORDER BY suffix to the queries FROM INSIDE THE SEARCHHANDLER. This should make it possible to sort the list with no performance hit, woo hoo!
