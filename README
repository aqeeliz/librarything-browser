LibraryThing Browser

This is an experimental simple offline browser for LibraryThing users using
Android devices. You can download your library and use it offline to search 
and browse your books and reviews, but you can't edit the data. 
 
I am not affiliated with LibraryThing in any way, just a keen user
tinkering in my spare time.  
 
Released under the MIT Expat Licence. 
 
The ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and INTERNET permissions are required in order to
download your library from the LibraryThing website, and that is the only
thing that network access is used for.
