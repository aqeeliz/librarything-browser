This is an experimental simple offline browser for LibraryThing users. You can
download your library and use it offline to search and browse your books and
reviews, but you can't edit the data. 
 
I am not affiliated with LibraryThing in any way, just a keen user tinkering
in my spare time.

The ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and INTERNET permissions are required in order to
download your library from the LibraryThing website. Network access can also
used for sending debugging logs to the developer at your choice, although this
is not normally used and is disabled by default.
